### To do
- Hi Jump Kick crash damage is now (always) equal to half of the user's max HP, rounded down.
- Hi Jump Kick: The user can now crash due to a target's type immunity.
- Future Sight should use the Sp. Def. of the opponent it hits, not of the active opponent at the time of activation. Use the code from Beat Up for inspiration.
- Beat Up should use Attack of move user, including boosts, benefit from STAB and deal Dark-type damage. Its formula also changed.
- Ghost-type Pokémon should be able to switch from binding moves.
- Lock-On's effect should last until the end of the next turn rather than until the user makes its next move.
- Lock-On should fail if the user is already taking aim at a Pokémon. It will not fail if the Pokémon it was taking aim at fainted or switched out.
- If a Pokémon traps a target with Mean Look and then switches with Baton Pass the target should no longer be trapped.
- Mimicked moves should have the max PP as opposed to 5.
- Toxic should be separate from other forms of recurrent damage (not building from them or affecting their strength).

- (Multi Hit moves) If the user is holding a King's Rock or Razor Fang, each consecutive hit has an equal chance to cause the opponent to flinch.
- Instead of doubling the Special Defense of affected Pokémon, Light Screen now technically halves the damage done to them by special moves; it still does not reduce damage done by moves that deal direct damage.
- Curse can now hit through a substitute.
- If a cursed Pokémon defeats its opponent, it now takes curse damage on that turn.
- Conversion 2 will not change the user to any of its current types.
- Conversion 2 is not affected by Substitute, Protect or Detect.
- Destiny Bond will always fail if it was successfully executed on the previous turn.
- A Pokémon defeated by this move will now faint after the Pokémon that used Destiny Bond, meaning that if Destiny Bond is used by the last Pokémon on a player's team, and the last Pokémon on the opposing team makes it faint, the opposing player will win.
